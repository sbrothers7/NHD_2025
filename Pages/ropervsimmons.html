                    <p>"The present case involves a death sentence imposed on Christopher Simmons for a murder he committed at the age of 17 in the State of Missouri.</p>
                    <p>Along with another juvenile even younger than he was, Simmons broke into the home of a lady named Shirley Crook.</p>
                    <p>They bound and gagged her using the ropes and duck tape and then drove her in her own car to a railroad trestle spanning a river.</p>
                    <p>Simmons and his accomplice bound Mrs. Crook more security and threw her from the trestle drowning her in the waters below.</p>
                    <p>There was no doubt that Simmons is guilty of the offense."</p>

            <h2>8th Amendment</h2>
            <p>“Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” Excessiveness is prohibited by law. Arguing that imposing the death penalty on juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on excessive punishment, as executing young offenders are considered harsh given their age. “The juvenile justice system became increasingly harsh and punitive and lost its rehabilitative ideals.” (Juvenile Law Center)</p>
            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <h2>14th Amendment</h2>
            <p>The 14th Amendment ensures that all individuals receive equal protection. Juvenile death sentences violate these principles by imposing disproportionate and inhumane punishments on young offenders who possess a greater capacity for change and rehabilitation. Supreme Court has consistently upheld that harsh penalties are unconstitutional, aligning with the 14th Amendment's guarantees of fairness and equality.</p>
            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <h2>Decision</h2>
            <p>This decision was made under the consensus that juveniles show a lack of maturity compared to adults and therefore carry less responsibility comparably. Moreover, juveniles are shown to be more likely to undergo successful rehabilitation. The Supreme Court had argued that the United States was the only country that allowed the execution of juvenile defendants, which was contradictory to international norms. This set the foundation for future decisions and served as the turning point in the transition to more rehabilitative methods for juveniles.</p>
