            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">“In any case, the death penalty may not be pronounced on a protected person who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the offence.” (“Estados Unidos 9647”)</p>
            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <p>When we think of rights and responsibilities, the law stands as a critical bridge between them. Laws are unique in that they safeguard individual rights while also enforcing societal responsibilities. Ironically, rights and responsibilities can be challenging to co-exist in some cases. This causes complex dilemmas, particularly in cases of juvenile justice.</p>
            <p>Our topic, Roper v. Simmons, delves into this tension, exploring how the legal system can balance the rights of young offenders with their accountability for serious crimes. The Roper v. Simmons decision brings this issue to the forefront, reshaping the way that the justice system addresses the delicate intersection of rights and responsibilities for minors.</p>
            <p>The Code of Hammurabi (1754 BC), the United States Declaration of Independence (1776), and the 4.13 Constitutional Protection in Korea (1987) are examples in history of how the rule of law has been essential in shaping societies and ensuring justice. Throughout the ages, the concept of law has been a foundational pillar of society. From ancient times to today, laws have been established to resolve disputes fairly and justly. It promotes fairness within society so all members of society are treated equally.</p>
            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">“The United Nations (UN) system, the rule of law, is a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions, and entities…are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards.” (United Nations)</p>
            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <p>The Rule of Law and any legal framework are fundamental to humanitarian principles and human rights. Juvenile justice serves as both protection for young individuals and a lesson for the youth who will one day lead society. </p>
