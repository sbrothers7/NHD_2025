                    <p>Death penalties are beyond what we call the rights of humans. It strippes individual's humanity regardless of the cruel crime they commit. Furthermore, juveniles are growing, inexperienced teenagers, therefore deserve a chance from society to repent. This does not mean that their age does not grant them a free pass—rights come with responsibilities.</p>

                    <p>“As of January 1, 1986 there are 162 states parties to this Convention, including the United States. This Convention applies to periods of international armed conflict and Article 68 forbids the execution of civilians and military personnel no longer in combat, who committed offenses prior to the age of 18. If nearly all the nations of the world, including the United States, have agreed to such a norm for periods of international armed conflict, the norm protecting juvenile offenders from execution ought to apply with even greater force for periods of peace.” (“Estados Unidos 9647”)</p>

            <p>Some juvenile delinquents in society fail to reflect on their mistakes and take responsibility. In 2023, 9 teens (of ages between 15 and 17) escaped from the Pennsylvanian juvenile detention center and were captured after overpowering two female prison employees, taking their keys, and attempting car theft.</p>
            <p>Juveniles must not undermine the integrity of the law. The legal system exists to uphold justice, ensuring that those who commit crimes undergo appropriate punishments. However, it is crucial that juvenile offenders reflect on their actions and understand the weight of their decisions. While they are provided certain rights, these must be accompanied by a corresponding sense of responsibility. Therefore, we advocate for a strengthening of the Juvenile Act to ensure that rights and responsibilities are balanced, fostering justice in our society.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">“Strengthening the rule of law involves respect for the norms of international law, including on the use of force, and recognition of the primary responsibility of States to protect their populations from genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes.” (United Nations)</p>

            <p>Rights come with responsibility, and strengthening the Juvenile Act is essential to maintaining this balance in society.</p>
